you=What can you tell me about the Book of the Dead?
him=The Book of the Dead tells of redemption for those who sign their name in gravebloom ink. Your sins will be washed away, and you will be able to return to wherever you were banished from.
you=So, where can I find gravebloom ink?
him=Gravebloom ink is not something you find. You must make it yourself. Besides the Gravebloom flower, you will need to sacrifice your own blood with a special blade.
him=Even if you can create some gravebloom ink, you won't be able to write with just anything. The ink won't stick to a normal quill. You will need to find something capable of holding the gravebloom ink.
him=If you can perform the ritual to make gravebloom ink and find a suitable writing utensil, redemption may be yours.

you=Do you think this quill is capable of holding gravebloom ink?
him=It's certainly no normal quill. I've never seen anything like it.
set_status=emp_main_info2
him=If anything is capable of writing with gravebloom ink, it is that quill.

you=Do you know anything about this knife?
set_status=emp_main_info3
him=The Knife of Sacrifices. This must be the blade you will need to draw your blood for the gravebloom ink. From what I've read, this must be done at the "Red Altar".
you=I recall such an altar from the Temple of Mez.
him=I don't know why this blade in particular is required to make the ink. Once it pierces your skin, there is no telling what effect it will have on you. Please keep this in mind.

him=I can create a small amount of gravebloom ink for you, but I require a Gravebloom flower accomplish this. Return to me with both the flower and the blood.

requires_item=1100:1,1103:1
you=I completed the ritual at the Red Altar. What now?
him=We are ready to create a small amount of gravebloom ink. Allow me to perform the mixing.
him=The correct ratio of Gravebloom to blood is important. Too much Gravebloom will cause the ink to eat through the paper. Too little Gravebloom and the ink won't adhere to the quill.
him=(Florin carefully mixes the two elements into a small inkwell, alternating the additions of Gravebloom and blood.)

him=If you plan on venturing further, you'll need to learn how to use the resources that you come across.
him=I can show you how to mix potions, but I don't have any ingredients on hand.
him=Can I ask you to procure some elements for me? I require one each of the following: Aloe Vera, Mana Crystal, and Mushrooms.
you=I can do that.
set_status=emp_alchemy_init
him=Then return to me with these items, and I will make it worth your time.

him=Thank you. I was able to find some Aloe Vera on my own, so you can keep what you found.
him=Also, take these empty bottles along with this mortar and pestle. You can use the mortar and pestle with that Aloe Vera you found to make a fine healing potion.
him=If you ever lose that mortar and pestle, you can always speak to me if you want some potions made.
